pdf files in **tasks-pdf** are property of CTU.

The code presented there is listed under "public open source code" so do not copy and/or redistribute code in **tasks-source** it would be considered plagiarism, all solved tasks here are just for your inspiration
_(when you are stuck e.g. at some point)_ .

Do it yourself, write it yourself. At least you will learn something.

This git serves as the _open personal repository_ for courses **A4M33PAL** and **AE4M33PAL**

The solutions are intended to be written both in C and Java.

The reason is to show the strenght and weaknesses both C and Java and "how to write code in them" to get most of the target language.
